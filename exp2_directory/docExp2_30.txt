today go history greatest demonstration freedom
crippled manacles segregation chains discrimination one

flames withering injustice came joyous daybreak
daybreak end long night captivity one
proclamation momentous decree came great beacon
chains discrimination one hundred years later
come nations capital cash check architects

justice time lift nation quicksands racial
believe insufficient funds great vaults opportunity
people bad check check come back
exile land come today dramatize shameful
negro lives lonely island poverty midst
insufficient funds great vaults opportunity nation
go history greatest demonstration freedom history
riches freedom security justice also come
momentous decree came great beacon light
believe bank justice bankrupt refuse believe
withering injustice came joyous daybreak end
