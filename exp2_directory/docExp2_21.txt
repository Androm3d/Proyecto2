time lift nation quicksands racial injustice
vast ocean material prosperity one hundred
valley segregation sunlit path racial justice
negro slaves seared flames withering injustice
years ago great american whose symbolic
i happy join today go history
island poverty midst vast ocean material
brotherhood time make justice reality gods
would guaranteed unalienable rights life liberty
hundred years later life negro still
defaulted promissory note insofar citizens color
democracy time rise dark desolate valley
one hundred years later negro lives
note every american fall heir note
justice time lift nation quicksands racial
funds refuse believe bank justice bankrupt
drug gradualism time make real promises
justice also come hallowed spot remind
wrote magnificent words constitution declaration independence
solid rock brotherhood time make justice
crippled manacles segregation chains discrimination one
prosperity one hundred years later negro
america given negro people bad check
concerned instead honoring sacred obligation america
came joyous daybreak end long night
yes black men well white men
come hallowed spot remind america fierce
