racial justice time lift nation
rights life liberty pursuit happiness
signing promissory note every american
history nation five score years
slaves seared flames withering injustice
whose symbolic shadow stand today
injustice solid rock brotherhood time
would guaranteed unalienable rights life
still languished corners american society
believe insufficient funds great vaults
today dramatize shameful condition sense
came joyous daybreak end long
people bad check check come
came great beacon light hope
bankrupt refuse believe insufficient funds
every american fall heir note
later negro still languished corners
vaults opportunity nation come cash

riches freedom security justice also
nations capital cash check architects

america defaulted promissory note insofar
real promises democracy time rise
american society finds exile land
drug gradualism time make real
check architects republic wrote magnificent
light hope millions negro slaves
