captivity one hundred years later
fierce urgency time engage luxury
momentous decree came great beacon
greatest demonstration freedom history nation
bankrupt refuse believe insufficient funds
racial justice time lift nation
american fall heir note promise
later negro lives lonely island
independence signing promissory note every
path racial justice time lift
racial injustice solid rock brotherhood
negro still languished corners american
manacles segregation chains discrimination one
heir note promise men yes
society finds exile land come
men well white men would
cash check architects republic wrote
men yes black men well
wrote magnificent words constitution declaration
negro still sadly crippled manacles
guaranteed unalienable rights life liberty
negro still free one hundred
condition sense come nations capital
hope millions negro slaves seared
great vaults opportunity nation come
bank justice bankrupt refuse believe
signed emancipation proclamation momentous decree
gradualism time make real promises
note promise men yes black
time engage luxury cooling take
drug gradualism time make real
long night captivity one hundred
segregation sunlit path racial justice
lives lonely island poverty midst
insofar citizens color concerned instead
time make real promises democracy
